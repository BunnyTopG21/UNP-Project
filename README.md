# Engineering Graduate Salaries Classification and Medical Insurance Premium Regression

Welcome to the repository for our **Engineering Graduate Salaries Classification** and **Medical Insurance Premium Regression** group project. This project demonstrates the application of Python, machine learning, and artificial neural networks (ANN) to solve real-world problems using structured data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

This project was undertaken as part of an internship program facilitated by our college in collaboration with **UNP Education Online**, a remote internship group project organized by the **United Network of Professionals (UNP), **. The internship focused on developing practical skills in Data Science and Machine Learning using Python.

1. **Classification Task:** 
   - Predicting engineering graduate salary classifications.
   - Using a variety of machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques.

2. **Regression Task:**
   - Estimating medical insurance premiums.
   - Leveraging regression models and artificial neural networks (ANN).

## Repository Contents

- **PDF Presentations:**
  - Two presentation slides summarizing the project in detail, available in .pdf

- **Google Drive Link (in `My-UNP-Project-Work-Google-Drive-Link.txt`):**
  - Contains: Google Drive Link that has the below mentioned files.
    - Presentation files in `.pptx` format.
    - Google Colab notebooks (`.ipynb`) with code implementations.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling null values.
- Replacing missing values with appropriate measures.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Dropping irrelevant features.
- Creating dummy variables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzing data distributions, trends, and relationships.
- Visualizing data for better understanding.

### Algorithms Used
**Before VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) Analysis:**
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- AdaBoost
- XGBoost

**After VIF Analysis:**
- All the above algorithms applied again with reduced multicollinearity in features.

### Neural Networks (ANN)
- Developed and trained Artificial Neural Networks for regression.
- Compared ANN performance with traditional regression models.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras (for ANN)
- **Platforms:** Google Colab
